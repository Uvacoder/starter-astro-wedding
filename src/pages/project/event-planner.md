<h1>Day-of event packages</h1>
<h2>This package may include any of the following tasks:</h2> 
<ul>
  <li>Run-through during rehearsal of what clients want the day to look like, making sure you’re both on the same page
  </li>
  <li>Creating a detailed and comprehensive itinerary of the day for the wedding party, including any activities, photoshoots, and such they will participate in
  </li>
  <li>A walkthrough of the venue and reception site to make sure everything is in order prior to the actual event
  </li>
  <li>A checklist and itinerary for vendors, providing a timeline for the day and any last-minute changes
  Assisting and managing set-up of the ceremony and reception sites (Are all the plates in the right places? Where is the guest book?)
  </li>
  <li>Management of the wedding day (While your clients are getting married and enjoying themselves, it’ll be your job to make sure everything is running on time and in order, as well as providing any additional aid, be it finding that perfect red lipstick or making sure everyone is at the right table.)
  </li>
  <li>Being available for any questions or concerns from guests, the wedding party, and vendors
  </li>
  <li>Making sure the day and night go off with a hitch and that everything that needs to get done, does so.
  </li>
</ul>
